# GetCspLoginBonus
Launches Clip Studio Paint and jumps to the Login Bonus page. ~~CELSYS Y U DELETE LOGIN BONUS PAGE FROM MENU~~  
This creates a shortcut of `cmd.exe` that launches CSP installed in your computer and make it directly jump to the event page. This does not include, alter, nor backward-engineer said software. 

## Security Disclaimer
- Only download this program **directly from the official GitHub repository**: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/marrshmallow/PowerShellApps/)
- Do _**NOT**_ run this program if you obtained it from an untrusted or unofficial source.
- The program extracts files (e.g., `.ps1` and `.bat`) required for functionality. Tampered files can be harmful.

## How to Use
1. Mark your calendar and set notification.
2. Download the `.zip` file from the [Release page](about:blank).
3. Unzip (to a new folder) and run the `CreateCspShortcut.exe` file. This will create a shortcut in the same directory.
4. Drag the shortcut to your taskbar and vice versa.
5. Hit the created shortcut `LaunchCspLoginBonusPage` and never miss a single day.

I don't know which is more tedious -- scrolling down to find and click on the thumbnail of the event page, or writing and documenting this stuff ___\*punchline sting\*___

## Uninstallation
Simply delete the `.exe` file and any extracted files (e.g., `.ps1`, `.bat`, `.ico`). I recommend extracting the file to a folder and delete the whole folder.
