# GetCspLoginBonus
Launches Clip Studio Paint and jumps to the Login Bonus page. ~~CELSYS Y U DELETE LOGIN BONUS PAGE FROM MENU~~  
This creates a shortcut of `cmd.exe` that launches CSP installed in your computer and make it directly jump to the event page. This does not include, alter, nor backward-engineer said software. 
## How to use
1. Clone the repository and run `Program.cs` in your IDE
2. Drag the created shortcut (`Scripts/LaunchCspLoginBonusPage.lnk`) to your taskbar
3. Mark your calendar and set notification
4. Hit the shortcut and never miss a single day

I don't know which is more tedious -- scrolling down to find and click on the thumbnail of the event page, or writing and documenting this stuff ___\*punchline sting\*___
