# GetCspLoginBonus
Launches Clip Studio Paint and jumps to the Login Bonus page. ~~CELSYS Y U DELETE LOGIN BONUS PAGE FROM HOME~~  
## How to use
1. Make a shortcut of `Scripts\OpenCspLoginBonusPage.bat` wherever you want, e.g. drag it to your taskbar for quick access
2. Mark your calendar and set notification
3. Hit the button and never miss a day

I don't know which is more tedious -- scrolling down to find and click on the thumbnail of the event page, or writing and documenting this stuff ___\*punchline sting\*___
